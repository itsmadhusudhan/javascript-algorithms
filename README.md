This repository is a copy of https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms#readme which contains JavaScript based examples of algorithms and data structures.

I have recreating the entire repository learning one algorithm and data structure at a time instead of just cloning the original repo.

This is the first time I'm using linting, pre-commit and  CI.
